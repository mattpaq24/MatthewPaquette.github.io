                    <p>TREES helps new undergrad students ease in to university life. Students take an introductory

                    <p>Prior to this project, plans could only be created by university administrators through a
                        desktop-exclusive tool. </p>
                    <p>To bring more action plans to the TREES mobile app, I was asked to design a tool that would allow
                        for
                        users to create action plans on mobile devices.</p>

                    <p><strong>Goal: </strong>Design a plan creation tool (PCT) that allows users to create-step-by-step

                        plans from their mobile devices</p>

                        <li>Research, Interviews</li>

                    <h3 class="subhead">INTERVIEWING</h3>
                    <p>Beyond considering the needs of plan creators, I felt that understanding the needs of plan
                        consumers (university students) should inform the structure of the PCT. This way, I could design
                        the PCT so that plan creators can more easily create plans that align with consumer needs.</p>
                    <p>To understand both consumer and creator needs, I talked to students and advisors from three
                        private universities in Nova Scotia, and two public universities in California.</p>
                    <p>I conducted one-on-one interviews, and led a focus group consisting of peer leaders at one of the
                        schools in Nova Scotia.</p>

                    <h3 class="subhead">SIGNIFIGANT TAKEAWAYS AND INSIGHTS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students feel a greater sense of belonging on campus when they are connected to real people.
                            The PCT should incentivize the creation of plans that lead to interaction, not a substitute.
                        </li>
                        <li>Students have difficulty engaging with school resources when they have to traverse through a
                            myriad of portals and web pages. I should consider the organizational systems students use,
                            and build the PCT so that creators make plans that allow consumers to integrate the
                            information withing plans into their existing organizational systems.</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>In lieu of building user journey maps, I made a plan journey map. I felt that this alternative
                        map would allow me to understand the full context of plan creation, and help me understand how
                        the needs of creators and consumers relate to each other.</p>

                    <p>I started by compiling a list of the data and functional needs of plan consumers. I created this
                        list
                        by referring back to my interview notes and identifying the data objects and functions present

                    <p>After amassing a comprehensive list of requirements, I reached out to stakeholders and the dev
                        team to ensure that meeting these requirements would be desired and technically feasible. I
                        refined the list to these elements based on these conversations:</p>
